Hi there! Before I explain any further, backup your worlds before installing this config pack, just in case! There's always a (really dumb) bug in Minecraft just waiting to be discovered, so daily backups are a good idea anyway provided you have the hard disk space.

To satisfy the licences of the supported mods, none of them are included in this pack; you will need to find copies yourself. Google is your friend. ;)

Also, if you play multiplayer and your config settings don't match the server, this causes problems. In a battle between client and server, the server always wins; it calls the shots on recipe and crafting settings as well as everything else, so make sure your client and server configs will match if you plan on using this config pack! If you have to ask whether they match or not, the answer is probably no.

If you are playing singleplayer, you are both the client and server so you're guaranteed to have matching configs and no problems. This config pack is designed for solo play or lazy/new server admins and their players.

To install this config pack on your personal client or a server:

1) Find your Minecraft folder with the modpack you play, or a custom modpack of your own that you want to make compatible.
2) Copy the entire "config" folder in the MAIN folder over your Minecraft folders with the same name, which should completely overwrite its contents with the new settings.

And then you're done!
