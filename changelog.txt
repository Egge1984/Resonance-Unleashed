== Changelog ==

= 2.0.0.0 = 14 September 2013
- The long hiatus is over!
- Existing 1.5.* support updated to the latest versions of supported modpacks:
  * FTB Unleashed [1.1.4]
  * Direwolf20 1.5 Edition v2 [1.1.4]
  * Resonant Rise [1.0.0-RC3]
- This updates adds support for all the mods added since the last update, of particular note is the addition of Artifice and ChocoCraft
- Immibis' Microblocks cuttable data renewed again (this will be a regular thing and can be assumed from now on)
- 1.5.2 IDMap data updated
- THIS IS THE LAST TIME 1.5.* SUPPORT WILL BE UPDATED; 1.5.* SUPPORT CEASES FROM HERE ON OUT
- Due to overwhelming futility caused by Forge changes in 1.6.* and the FTB config problem, mIDas features have been suspended and will likely stay suspended into Minecraft 1.7.*. They will return when it once again becomes practical to import old worlds.
- Experimental support for 1.6.* added: there are currently no official modpacks using 1.6.*, but this config pack is being used to develop the new RR pack at the time of writing
- THE 1.6.* SUPPORT IS SUBJECT TO HEAVY CHANGE AND MAY HAVE MODS REMOVED AS WELL AS ADDED
- By request, the 1.4.7 configs from this pack's predecessor have been reinstated; they are unchanged

= 1.1.1.0 = 3 August 2013
- Existing support updated to the latest versions of supported modpacks:
  * FTB Unleashed [1.1.2]
  * Direwolf20 1.5 Edition [1.1.2]
- Block/item IDs adjusted to more closely match FTB Unleashed once again
- mIDas support updated to latest versions of packs and RU
- Immibis' Microblocks internal "I-can-cut-this" block map fixed to work with RU
