== WARNING ==

As of 14th September 2013 until further notice, this feature has been suspended.

You will need to create fresh worlds for 1.6.* no matter what, so maintaining this feature has become impractical. It will return when the Forge and FTB teams stop breaking worlds frequently.

You can, however, still attempt this manually on your own. :)

== END WARNING ==

As direct conversion between modpacks is no longer realistic, both because FTB no longer keeps its block/item IDs synced between packs and because Resonant Rise uses totally different IDs anyway, Resonant Unleashed contains support for the mIDas world converter.

BACKUP YOUR WORLDS BEFORE ATTEMPTING CONVERSION!

Currently, only conversions to Resonance Unleashed are directly supplied in the pack, but raw NEI dumps are provided for you to build your own patches yourself.

Download mIDas and follow the instructions to convert your worlds.
